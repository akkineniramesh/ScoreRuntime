Generating netlists with ScoreRuntime.
-----------------------------------------

ScoreRuntime performs operations once per timeslice. An option exists
to instruct the runtime system to output a netlist representing
streams between scheduled for each timeslice. Currently, connections
to the cpu are not output (that can be changed quickly, if desired).

> ScoreRuntime ... -netlist ...

With this option, ScoreRuntime will create a directory hiearchy and
emit netlists after each execution. The hiearchy has the following
structure:

.
`-- netlist
    |-- netlist_cp10_cmb20.1012613933
    |   |-- net.0
    |   |-- net.1
    |   |-- net.2
    |   |-- net.3
    |   |-- net.4
    |   |-- net.5
    |   |-- net.6
    |   |-- net.7
    |   `-- net.8
    `-- netlist_cp16_cmb16.1012613791
        |-- net.0
        |-- net.1
        |-- net.2
        |-- net.3
        |-- net.4
        |-- net.5
        `-- net.6


Directory 'netlist' will be automatically created (unless it already
exists) in the current directory. For each run, ScoreRuntime creates
directory named 'netlist_cpX_cmbY.T', where X is the number of CPs, Y
-- CMBs, and T is unix time in seconds since 01/01/1970. T prevents
old results from being overwritten, given the fact that one cannot run
two ScoreRuntime processes at the same time on the same machine.  In
each netlist_cpX_cmbY.T directory, one will find net.<timeslice>
files. These are netlists for each timeslice, formatted as follows:

-----------------------------
<number of nets>
<id1>\t<id2>
<id3>\t<id4>
<id5>\t<id6>
..
.
-------eof-------------------

Each line contains a net with one source and one sink, since streams
are used. Node ids are computed in the following manner:

id(CP[i])  = 2 * i
id(CMB[i]) = 2 * i + 1
