    Yep. It looks like asm/page.h, asm/elf.h, asm/user.h and linux/user.h
    are no longer installed in 2.6.25.

    For page.h, we'll need to patch so that getpagesize() or sysconf(
    _SC_PAGESIZE) is used instead of PAGE_SIZE. That's the way it always
    should have been, anyway. Which source file in perl is choking?
